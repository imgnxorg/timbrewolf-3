# Backend

In this directory, you will find two files: `back` and `front`.

Both are in `src/back/`, so, therefore, they contain source code (`src`) and/or distribution binaries (`dist`) for things that run on the back end (they are _private_, *NOT* public).

## `back`

"Command-line" interfaces and/or scripts that are bundled into the final `create taku app` CLI and/or API - hard-coded assets that manage the back end for both `src/front` and `src/back`. It's stuff that nobody ever sees.

Included: CLI, API, etc.

## `front`

This is a React Admin Portal. It's a "monitor" for the entire system; like a dashboard. This might also include things like Power BI,
